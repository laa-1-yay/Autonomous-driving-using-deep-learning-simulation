# Behaviorial Cloning Project
Used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

Simulator is used to steer a car around a track for data collection. Image data and steering angles were used to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

The project has five main files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car )
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* report.md (Describing the project) 
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track )
